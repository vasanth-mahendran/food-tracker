# food-tracker
Food tracker is a simple iOS application to add/edit/edit meals and rate it.
Developed it with the help Apple developer guide. Refer to for help -> https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1

Future work:
Learning and developing iOS app is really so much fun. I intend to learn more about iOS app and upgrade this app to help local hotel owners to manage their meals details
